Normally, in healthy weight individuals, leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier to influence brain activity in the areas of satiety and appetite suppression. Leptin also boosts glycemic control and metabolism. In overweight and obese people, leptin production is high, yet its function is diminished because the body becomes resistant to it. Leptin resistance results in increased appetite, poor blood sugar balance, and slower metabolism. GastrobiPlex\u00ae Capsules are clinically proven to lower leptin resistance and improve leptin function. This is a primary factor in GastrobiPlex\u2019s ability to promote weight-loss and fat reduction.<\/p><p>GastrobiPlex\u00ae Shake is an all natural dietary supplement that makes weight management easier by helping you feel full sooner and longer. That feeling of \u201csatiety\u201d makes it easier to stick to your diet\u2019s meal plan by minimizing feelings of hunger during and after meals. You will simply eat less!<\/p><p>The active component in GastrobiPlex\u00ae Shake is a natural protein called Proteinase Inhibitor II (PI2). [P12] works by enhancing the body\u2019s release of cholecystokinin (CCK), a natural compound created during digestion that signals the brain that food has been eaten, which helps to create feelings of fullness and satisfaction.<\/p><p>GastrobiPlex\u00ae Shake has been specially formulated to have an incredibly delicious taste, while being low in calories. GastrobiPlex\u00ae Shake will not stimulate metabolism or cause jitters, bloating, or other side effects commonly associated with other weight management products.<\/p><br><\/p>",

Normally, in healthy weight individuals, leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier to influence brain activity in the areas of satiety and appetite suppression. Leptin also boosts glycemic control and metabolism. In overweight and obese people, leptin production is high, yet its function is diminished because the body becomes resistant to it. Leptin resistance results in increased appetite, poor blood sugar balance, and slower metabolism. GastrobiPlex\u00ae Capsules are clinically proven to lower leptin resistance and improve leptin function. This is a primary factor in GastrobiPlex\u2019s ability to promote weight-loss and fat reduction.<br><\/p>",
